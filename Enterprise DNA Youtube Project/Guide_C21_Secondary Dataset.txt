Secondary Dataset - EDNA YouTube Channel Data Analysis - Challenge 21 - 18th July 2022.

This secondary set of data files contains 4 excel worksheets with different information about EDNA YouTube Channel. 
Please note these are to be worked with, independently from the main file as there is not direct connection between files provided. My take is to use it as 
disconnected tables from the main file.

The zip file containing this data can be found in the challenge Brief under the name of "Secondary_Dataset_C21"

These are;

1. Cities
2. Geography = Countries
3. Viewer Age Ranges
4. Viewer Gender

The datasets are self-explantory. Any problems please do not hesitate to post a comment in the forum or linkedin group. See links below.
